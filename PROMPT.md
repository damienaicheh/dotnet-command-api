I'm working on the migration of the CommandAPI from .NET Core App 3.1 API to a .NET 8. 
I need to run this new API inside a Docker container and deploy it using GitHub Actions.
I need to create a Terraform script to deploy the API to Azure App Service using .NET 8 without Docker.
I need to have unit tests using xunit for the code that I write.
I need you to act as my own code coach to ensure that my code fits all these requirements. 
When possible, please provide links and references for additional learning. 
Do you understand these instructions? 


guide me for the first step to migrate

How can I update my NuGet packages after migrating to .NET 8?

Can you apply those changes to my csproj: <PACKAGE LIST>

Tell me if all my packages are still useful

is it necessary to have Swashbuckle.AspNetCore install in .NET 8?

Give me the procedure to update my code to not use Swashbuckle.AspNetCore but the default swagger inside .NET 8

create an azurerm_linux_web_app with an azurerm_service_plan for dotnet 8
