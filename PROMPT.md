I'm working on the migration of the CommandAPI from ASP.NET 3.5 API to a .NET 8. 
I need to run this new API inside a Docker container and deploy it using GitHub Actions.
I need to have unit tests using xunit for the code that I write.
I need you to act as my own code coach to ensure that my code fits all these requirements. 
When possible, please provide links and references for additional learning. 
Do you understand these instructions?
